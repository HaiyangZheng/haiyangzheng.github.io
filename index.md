# 🎓 About Me
I am a second-year PhD student at the University of Trento, affiliated with the [MHUG](http://mhug.disi.unitn.it/#/) group. I am supervised by [Prof. Nicu Sebe](https://disi.unitn.it/~sebe/) and [Prof. Zhun Zhong](https://zhunzhong.site), and I am fortunate to work with [Prof. Nan Pu](https://tpcd.github.io/). 

Previously, I obtained my Master’s degree in Computer Technology from Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen, supervised by [Prof. Hongpeng Wang](https://homepage.hit.edu.cn/wanghongpeng), and my Bachelor’s degree in Vehicle Engineering from Harbin Institute of Technology, Weihai.

# 🎯 Research Interests
My research focuses on computer vision, with an emphasis on open-world visual recognition. I aim to develop models that can generalize knowledge learned in closed-set settings to dynamic, open-world scenarios. Recently, I am particularly interested in leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for open-world learning and recognition.

### Evolution of My Research Focus

* **Deep Image Clustering (Master’s Studies)**  
  My research journey began with deep image clustering, with a primary focus on clustering methods driven by data density information.

* **Open-World Category Discovery (PhD Year 1)**  
  Since clustering often admits multiple valid criteria, I shifted my focus toward transferring learned criteria from labeled data to unlabeled data in open-world settings, leading to research on Novel Class Discovery (NCD) and Generalized Category Discovery (GCD).

* **Looking Forward**  
  My future work aims to explore the open-world visual understanding capabilities of multimodal large language models.
